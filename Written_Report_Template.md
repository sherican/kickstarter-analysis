# Fever Kickstarter Campaign 

## Overview of Project
The purpose if this project is to use the is to use the insight gained from the analysis to help Louise run a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for her play *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed by using the data provided, which had Kickstarter information from previous years showing successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. I was able to analyze the statistics of the categories in the dataset, as well as outcomes based on launch date and goals. The biggest challenge was the Vlookup section, for some reason I couldn't get the chart to work.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Two conclusions that I can draw from the outcomes based on the launch date are that May was the peak month for both successful and failed outcomes and that the successful outcomes outweighed the failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes based on goals analysis shows that the percentage of failure and the percentage of success are close in number. Also, there were no canceled projects. Possible charts would include a chart showing the years that plays were most successful or a chart showing the outcomes for sci-fi in the US. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Possible charts would include a chart showing the years that plays were most successful or a chart showing the outcomes for sci-fi in the US.
